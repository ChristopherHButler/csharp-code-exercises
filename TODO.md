# TODO

 - How could you provide a better developer experience for others or yourself in the future?
   - Better code organisation and documentation.
 
 - What if you made an online code editor where these problems could be run and submitted?
   - I guess that is Hacker Rank / Interview Cake / Algo Expert... but still fun to build.
 
 - Would be nice to do this in other langauges as well for "exercise"

## Descriptions

 - Each problem needs a description (Or set of requirements)

## Levels

 - Need a way to tag how difficult a problem is (this is a bit of a relative measure but still...)

 - Easiest, Easy, Medium, Hard, Hardest, Impossible ?

## Categories

 - Should also be able to tag a category or categories (a problem can have one or more categories)

### Suggested categories
     
  - strings
  - numbers / math
    - is numebr even or odd
    - largest / smallest
    - compute area, volumen, etc
  - boolean
  - control flow (if, switch, )
  - loops (for, while, break, continue)
  - arrays
  - functions
    - conversions (metric -> imperial, temp, weight, etc, etc)
  - DateTime (time travel)
    - convert, days to years, etc
  - oop
  - recursion
  - file handling?
  - regex
  
  - LINQ

  - searching / sorting    
  - algorithms
    - types of algorithms
  
  - data structures
  
  - command / query ?

  - advent / adventure
